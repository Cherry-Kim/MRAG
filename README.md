CellNeighborEX: Deciphering Neighbor-Dependent Gene Expression from Spatial Transcriptomics Data
CellNeighborEX is a computational approach to identify genes up-regulated or down-regulated by immediate neighbors from spatial transcriptomics (ST) data at single cell or near cellular resolution. It works for both image-based and NGS-based ST data. For image-based ST data where exact cell locations are avai
